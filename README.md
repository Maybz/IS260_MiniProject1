## Mini Project 1 for IS260
### By Maybelline Ihara
This is a mini project in IS260 for Business Information Systems under the [College
of Micronesia](http://www.comfsm.fm), Business Division, CIS Program.

The goal of this mini-project is to create a small program in C++ that 
demonstrate demand forecasting based on future demand rather than past use.
